fracture separation object material two pieces action stress fracture solid usually occurs due development certain displacement discontinuity surfaces within solid displacement develops perpendicular surface displacement called normal tensile crack simply crack displacement develops tangentially surface displacement called shear crack slip band dislocation fracture strength breaking strength stress specimen fails fractures word fracture often applied bones living creatures e bone fracture crystalline materials gemstones metal sometimes individual crystals fracture without structure actually separating two pieces depending substance fracture reduces strength substances inhibits transmission waves light optical crystals detailed understanding fracture occurs materials may assisted study fracture mechanics
