structured program theorem also called bhm jacopini theorem result programming language theory states class control flow graphs historically called charts context compute computable function combines subprograms three specific ways control structures executing one subprogram another subprogram sequence executing one two subprograms according value boolean expression selection executing subprogram long boolean expression true iteration structured chart subject constraints may however use additional variables form bits stored extra integer variable original proof order keep track information original program represents program location construction based bhm programming language p
