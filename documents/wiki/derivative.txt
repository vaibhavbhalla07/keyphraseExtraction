derivative function real variable measures sensitivity change function value output value respect change argument input value derivatives fundamental tool calculus example derivative position moving object respect time object velocity measures quickly position object changes time advances derivative function single variable chosen input value exists slope tangent line graph function point tangent line best linear approximation function near input value reason derivative often described instantaneous rate change ratio instantaneous change dependent variable independent variable derivatives may generalized functions several real variables generalization derivative reinterpreted linear transformation whose graph appropriate translation best linear approximation graph original function jacobian matrix matrix represents linear transformation respect basis given choice independent dependent variables calculated terms partial derivatives respect independent variables real valued function several variables jacobian matrix reduces gradient vector process finding derivative called differentiation reverse process called antidifferentiation fundamental theorem calculus states antidifferentiation integration differentiation integration constitute two fundamental operations single variable calculus
