mathematics holomorphic function complex valued function one complex variables complex differentiable neighborhood every point domain existence complex derivative neighborhood strong condition implies holomorphic function actually infinitely differentiable equal taylor series analytic holomorphic functions central objects study complex analysis though term analytic function often used interchangeably holomorphic function word analytic defined broader sense denote function real complex general type written convergent power series neighborhood point domain fact holomorphic functions complex analytic functions vice versa major theorem complex analysis holomorphic functions also sometimes referred regular functions holomorphic function whose domain whole complex plane called entire function phrase holomorphic point z means differentiable z differentiable everywhere within neighborhood z complex plane
