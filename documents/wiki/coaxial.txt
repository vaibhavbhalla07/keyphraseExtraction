geometry coaxial means two three dimensional linear forms share common axis thus concentric three dimensional linear forms coaxial cable common example three dimensional linear structure wire conductor centre d circumferential outer conductor b insulating medium called dielectric c separating two conductors outer conductor usually sheathed protective pvc outer jacket common axis dimension material conductors insulation determine cable characteristic impedance attenuation various frequencies loudspeaker design coaxial speakers loudspeaker system individual driver units radiate sound point axis coaxial weapon mount places two weapons roughly axis weapons usually side side one top technically par axial rather coaxial however distances involved mean effectively coaxial far operator concerned
