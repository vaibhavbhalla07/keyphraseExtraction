object oriented functional programming immutable object unchangeable object object whose state cannot modified created contrast mutable object changeable object modified created cases object considered immutable even internally used attributes change object state appears unchanging external point view example object uses memoization cache results expensive computations could still considered immutable object strings concrete objects typically expressed immutable objects improve readability runtime efficiency object oriented programming immutable objects also useful inherently thread safe benefits simpler understand reason offer higher security mutable objects
