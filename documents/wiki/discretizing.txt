mathematics discretization process transferring continuous functions models variables equations discrete counterparts process usually carried first step toward making suitable numerical evaluation implementation digital computers dichotomization special case discretization number discrete classes approximate continuous variable binary variable creating dichotomy modeling purposes binary classification discretization also related discrete mathematics important component granular computing context discretization may also refer modification variable category granularity multiple discrete variables aggregated multiple discrete categories fused whenever continuous data discretized always amount discretization error goal reduce amount level considered negligible modeling purposes hand terms discretization quantization often denotatively synonymous always connotatively interchangeable two terms share semantic field true discretization error quantization error mathematical methods relating discretization include eulermaruyama method zero order hold
