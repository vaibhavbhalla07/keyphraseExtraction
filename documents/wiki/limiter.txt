electronics limiter circuit allows signals specified input power level pass unaffected attenuating peaks stronger signals exceed threshold limiting type dynamic range compression clipping extreme version limiting limiting process specified characteristic usually amplitude output device prevented exceeding predetermined value limiters common safety device live sound broadcast applications prevent sudden volume peaks occurring limiters also used protective features components sound reinforcement systems e g powered mixing boards power amplifiers bass amps prevent unwanted distortion speaker damage
