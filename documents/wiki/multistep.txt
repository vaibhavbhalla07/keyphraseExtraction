linear multistep methods used numerical solution ordinary differential equations conceptually numerical method starts initial point takes short step forward time find next solution point process continues subsequent steps map solution single step methods euler method refer one previous point derivative determine current value methods rungekutta take intermediate steps example half step obtain higher order method discard previous information taking second step multistep methods attempt gain efficiency keeping using information previous steps rather discarding consequently multistep methods refer several previous points derivative values case linear multistep methods linear combination previous points derivative values used
