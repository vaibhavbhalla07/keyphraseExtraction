shaft alignment process aligning two shafts within tolerated margin absolute requirement machinery machinery put service driver like electric motor turbine coupled pump generator piece equipment essential shafts two pieces aligned misalignment two increases stress shafts almost certainly result excessive wear premature breakdown equipment costly equipment production might also bearings mechanical seals may damaged need replaced flexible couplings designed allow driver electric motor engine turbine hydraulic motor connected driven equipment flexible couplings use elastomeric insert allow slight degree misalignment flexible couplings also use shim packs couplings called disc couplings tools used achieve alignment may mechanical optical like laser shaft alignment method gyroscope based gyroscope based systems operated time efficient also even used shafts large distance e g marine vessels shaft alignment done also essential foundations driver driven piece designed installed correctly case shaft alignment started resulting fault alignment achieved within demanded specifications shaft misalignment may parallel angular misalignment cause increased vibration loads machine parts designed e improper operation
