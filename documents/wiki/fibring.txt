optical fiber optical fibre flexible transparent fiber made drawing glass silica plastic diameter slightly thicker human hair optical fibers used often means transmit light two ends fiber find wide usage fiber optic communications permit transmission longer distances higher bandwidths data rates wire cables fibers used instead metal wires signals travel along less loss addition fibers immune electromagnetic interference problem metal wires suffer excessively fibers also used illumination imaging often wrapped bundles may used carry light images confined spaces case fiberscope specially designed fibers also used variety applications fiber optic sensors fiber lasers optical fibers typically include core surrounded transparent cladding material lower index refraction light kept core phenomenon total internal reflection causes fiber act waveguide fibers support many propagation paths transverse modes called multi mode fibers mmf support single mode called single mode fibers smf multi mode fibers generally wider core diameter used short distance communication links applications high power must transmitted single mode fibers used communication links longer meters ft able join optical fibers low loss important fiber optic communication complex joining electrical wire cable involves careful cleaving fibers precise alignment fiber cores coupling aligned cores applications demand permanent connection fusion splice common technique electric arc used melt ends fibers together another common technique mechanical splice ends fibers held contact mechanical force temporary semi permanent connections made means specialized optical fiber connectors field applied science engineering concerned design application optical fibers known fiber optics term coined indian physicist narinder singh kapany widely acknowledged father fiber optics
