computer science binary search also known half interval search logarithmic search binary chop search algorithm finds position target value within sorted array binary search compares target value middle element array unequal half target cannot lie eliminated search continues remaining half successful search ends remaining half empty target array binary search runs worst logarithmic time making o log n comparisons n number elements array o big o notation log logarithm binary search takes constant o space meaning space taken algorithm number elements array although specialized data structures designed fast searchingsuch hash tablescan searched efficiently binary search applies wider range problems although idea simple implementing binary search correctly requires attention subtleties exit conditions midpoint calculation numerous variations binary search particular fractional cascading speeds binary searches value multiple arrays efficiently solving series search problems computational geometry numerous fields exponential search extends binary search unbounded lists binary search tree b tree data structures based binary search
