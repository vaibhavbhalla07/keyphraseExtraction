thread local storage tls computer programming method uses static global memory local thread tls used places ordinary single threaded programs would use global variables would inappropriate multithreaded cases example situations functions use global variable set error condition example global variable errno used many functions c library errno global variable call system function one thread may overwrite value previously set call system function different thread possibly following code different thread could check error condition solution errno variable looks like global fact exists per threadi e lives thread local storage second use case would multiple threads accumulating information global variable avoid race condition every access global variable would protected mutex alternatively thread might accumulate thread local variable definition cannot read written threads implying race conditions threads synchronise final accumulation thread local variable single truly global variable many systems impose restrictions size thread local memory block fact often rather tight limits hand system provide least memory address pointer sized variable thread local allows use arbitrarily sized memory blocks thread local manner allocating memory block dynamically storing memory address block thread local variable
