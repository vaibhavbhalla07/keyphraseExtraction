everyday use kinematics speed object magnitude velocity rate change position thus scalar quantity average speed object interval time distance travelled object divided duration interval instantaneous speed limit average speed duration time interval approaches zero speed dimensions distance divided time si unit speed metre per second common unit speed everyday usage kilometre per hour us uk miles per hour air marine travel knot commonly used fastest possible speed energy information travel according special relativity speed light vacuum c metres per second approximately km h mph matter cannot quite reach speed light would require infinite amount energy relativity physics concept rapidity replaces classical idea speed
