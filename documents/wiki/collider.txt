collider type particle accelerator involving directed beams particles colliders may either ring accelerators linear accelerators may collide single beam particles stationary target two beams head colliders used research tool particle physics accelerating particles high kinetic energy letting impact particles analysis byproducts collisions gives scientists good evidence structure subatomic world laws nature governing may become apparent high energies tiny periods time therefore may hard impossible study ways
