pharmacological chaperone pharmacoperone protein chaperone small molecule enters cells serves molecular scaffolding order cause otherwise misfolded mutant proteins fold route correctly within cell mutation proteins often causes molecular misfolding results protein misrouting within cell accordingly mutant molecules may retain proper function end parts cell function inappropriate even deleterious cell function misfolded proteins usually recognized quality control system cell retained often destroyed recycled endoplasmic reticulum pharmacoperones correct folding misfolded proteins allowing pass cell quality control system become correctly routed since mutations often cause disease causing misfolding misrouting pharmacoperones potentially therapeutic agents since able correct defect diseases may susceptible treatments include diabetes inherited cataracts cystic fibrosis
