foveated imaging digital image processing technique image resolution amount detail varies across image according one fixation points fixation point indicates highest resolution region image corresponds center eye retina fovea location fixation point may specified many ways example viewing image computer monitor one may specify fixation using pointing device like computer mouse eye trackers precisely measure eye position movement also commonly used determine fixation points perception experiments display manipulated use eye tracker known gaze contingent display fixations may also determined automatically using computer algorithms common applications foveated imaging include imaging sensor hardware image compression descriptions applications see list foveated imaging also commonly referred space variant imaging gaze contingent imaging
