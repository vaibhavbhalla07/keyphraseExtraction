voltage electric potential difference electric pressure electric tension formally denoted v u often simply v u instance context ohm kirchhoff circuit laws difference electric potential two points per unit electric charge voltage two points equal work done per unit charge static electric field move test charge two points measured units volts joule per coulomb voltage caused static electric fields electric current magnetic field time varying magnetic fields combination three voltmeter used measure voltage potential difference two points system often common reference potential ground system used one points voltage may represent either source energy electromotive force lost used stored energy potential drop
