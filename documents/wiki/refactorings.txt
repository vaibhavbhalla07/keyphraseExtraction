code refactoring process restructuring existing computer codechanging factoringwithout changing external behavior refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes software advantages include improved code readability reduced complexity improve source code maintainability create expressive internal architecture object model improve extensibility typically refactoring applies series standardised basic micro refactorings usually tiny change computer program source code either preserves behaviour software least modify conformance functional requirements many development environments provide automated support performing mechanical aspects basic refactorings done extremely well code refactoring may also resolve hidden dormant undiscovered bugs vulnerabilities system simplifying underlying logic eliminating unnecessary levels complexity done poorly may fail requirement external functionality changed introduce new bugs continuously improving design code make easier easier work sharp contrast typically happens little refactoring great deal attention paid expediently adding new features get hygienic habit refactoring continuously ll find easier extend maintain code
