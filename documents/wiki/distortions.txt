distortion alteration original shape characteristic something communications electronics means alteration waveform information bearing signal audio signal representing sound video signal representing images electronic device communication channel distortion usually unwanted engineers strive eliminate minimize situations however distortion may desirable example fm broadcasting noise reduction systems like dolby system audio signal deliberately distorted ways emphasize aspects signal subject electrical noise symmetrically undistorted passing noisy communication channel reducing noise signal distortion also used musical effect particularly electric guitars addition noise outside signals hum interference considered distortion though effects quantization distortion sometimes included noise quality measure explicitly reflects noise distortion signal noise distortion sinad ratio
