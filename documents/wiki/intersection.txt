mathematics intersection two objects another usually smaller object objects presumed lie certain common space except set theory intersection arbitrary sets defined intersection one basic concepts geometry intuitively intersection two objects new object lies original objects intersection various geometric shapes point common plane geometry definitions vary different contexts set theory formalizes idea smaller object lies larger object inclusion intersection sets formed elements belong intersecting sets always defined may empty incidence geometry defines intersection usually flats object lower dimension incident original objects approach intersection sometimes undefined parallel lines cases concept intersection relies logical conjunction algebraic geometry defines intersections way intersection theory
