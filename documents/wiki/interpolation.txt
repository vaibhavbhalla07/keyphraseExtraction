mathematical field numerical analysis interpolation method constructing new data points within range discrete set known data points engineering science one often number data points obtained sampling experimentation represent values function limited number values independent variable often required interpolate e estimate value function intermediate value independent variable different problem closely related interpolation approximation complicated function simple function suppose formula given function known complex evaluate efficiently known data points original function used create interpolation based simpler function course simple function used estimate data points original interpolation errors usually present however depending problem domain interpolation method used gain simplicity may greater value resultant loss precision examples consider x displaystyle x topological space function f displaystyle f forms different kind banach spaces problem treated interpolation operators classical results interpolation operators rieszthorin theorem marcinkiewicz theorem also many subsequent results
