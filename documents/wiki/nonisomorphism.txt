graph theory isomorphism graphs g h bijection vertex sets g h f v g v h displaystyle f colon v g v h two vertices u v g adjacent g u v adjacent h kind bijection commonly described edge preserving bijection accordance general notion isomorphism structure preserving bijection isomorphism exists two graphs graphs called isomorphic denoted g h displaystyle g simeq h case bijection mapping graph onto e g h one graph bijection called automorphism g graph isomorphism equivalence relation graphs partitions class graphs equivalence classes set graphs isomorphic called isomorphism class graphs two graphs shown isomorphic despite different looking drawings
