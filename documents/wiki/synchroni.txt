synchro effect transformer whose primary secondary coupling may varied physically changing relative orientation two windings synchros often used measuring angle rotating machine antenna platform general physical construction much like electric motor primary winding transformer fixed rotor excited alternating current electromagnetic induction causes currents flow three y connected secondary windings fixed degrees stator relative magnitudes secondary currents measured used determine angle rotor relative stator currents used directly drive receiver synchro rotate unison synchro transmitter latter case whole device may called selsyn portmanteau self synchronizing
