nerve enclosed cable like bundle axons nerve fibers long slender projections neurons peripheral nervous system nerve provides common pathway electrochemical nerve impulses transmitted along axons peripheral organs central nervous system analogous structures known tracts neurons sometimes called nerve cells though term potentially misleading since many neurons form nerves nerves also include non neuronal schwann cells coat axons myelin nerve cordlike structure containing bundles axons within nerve axon surrounded layer connective tissue called endoneurium axons bundled together groups called fascicles fascicle wrapped layer connective tissue called perineurium finally entire nerve wrapped layer connective tissue called epineurium
