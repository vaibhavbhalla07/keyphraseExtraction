retiming technique moving structural location latches registers digital circuit improve performance area power characteristics way preserves functional behavior outputs retiming first described charles e leiserson james b saxe technique uses directed graph vertices represent asynchronous combinational blocks directed edges represent series registers latches number registers latches zero vertex value corresponding delay combinational circuit represents one attempt optimize circuit pushing registers output input vice versa much like bubble pushing two operations used deleting register input vertex adding register outputs conversely adding register input vertex deleting register outputs cases rules followed circuit functional behavior retiming
