efficiency often measurable ability avoid wasting materials energy efforts money time something producing desired result general sense ability things well successfully without waste mathematical scientific terms measure extent input well used intended task function output often specifically comprises capability specific application effort produce specific outcome minimum amount quantity waste expense unnecessary effort efficiency course refers different inputs outputs different fields industries efficiency often confused effectiveness general efficiency measurable concept quantitatively determined ratio useful output total input effectiveness simpler concept able achieve desired result expressed quantitatively doesn usually require complicated mathematics addition efficiency often expressed percentage result could ideally expected example energy lost due friction causes case fuel input would used produce desired result always apply even cases efficiency assigned numerical value e g specific impulse common confusing way distinguishing efficiency effectiveness saying efficiency things right effectiveness right things saying indirectly emphasizes selection objectives production process important quality process saying popular business however obscures common sense effectiveness would produce following mnemonic efficiency things right effectiveness getting things done makes clear effectiveness example large production numbers also achieved inefficient processes example workers willing used working longer hours greater physical effort companies countries forced similarly company achieve effectiveness example large production numbers inefficient processes afford use energy per product example energy prices labor costs lower competitors example one may measure directly two objects communicating downloading music directly computer mobile device efficient using mobile device microphone record music sounds come computer speakers efficiency often measured ratio useful output total input expressed mathematical formula r p c p amount useful output product produced per amount c cost resources consumed may correspond percentage products consumables quantified compatible units consumables transformed products via conservative process example analysis energy conversion efficiency heat engines thermodynamics product p may amount useful work output consumable c amount high temperature heat input due conservation energy p never greater c efficiency r never greater fact must even less finite temperatures
