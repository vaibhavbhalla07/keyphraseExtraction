computing memoization memoisation optimization technique used primarily speed computer programs storing results expensive function calls returning cached result inputs occur memoization also used contexts purposes speed gains simple mutually recursive descent parsing general top parsing algorithm accommodates ambiguity left recursion polynomial time space although related caching memoization refers specific case optimization distinguishing forms caching buffering page replacement context logic programming languages memoization also known tabling see also lookup table
