materials science quenching rapid cooling workpiece water oil air obtain certain material properties type heat treating quenching prevents undesired low temperature processes phase transformations occurring reducing window time undesired reactions thermodynamically favorable kinetically accessible instance quenching reduce crystal grain size metallic plastic materials increasing hardness metallurgy quenching commonly used harden steel introducing martensite case steel must rapidly cooled eutectoid point temperature austenite becomes unstable steel alloyed metals nickel manganese eutectoid temperature becomes much lower kinetic barriers phase transformation remain allows quenching start lower temperature making process much easier high speed steel also added tungsten serves raise kinetic barriers give illusion material cooled rapidly really even cooling alloys slowly air desired effects quenching extremely rapid cooling prevent formation crystal structure resulting amorphous metal metallic glass
