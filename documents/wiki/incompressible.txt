fluid mechanics generally continuum mechanics incompressible flow isochoric flow refers flow material density constant within fluid parcelan infinitesimal volume moves flow velocity equivalent statement implies incompressibility divergence flow velocity zero see derivation illustrates conditions equivalent incompressible flow imply fluid incompressible shown derivation right conditions even compressible fluids good approximation modelled incompressible flow incompressible flow implies density remains constant within parcel fluid moves flow velocity
