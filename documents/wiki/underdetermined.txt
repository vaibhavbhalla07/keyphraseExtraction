mathematics system linear equations system polynomial equations considered underdetermined fewer equations unknowns contrast overdetermined system equations unknowns terminology explained using concept constraint counting unknown seen available degree freedom equation introduced system viewed constraint restricts one degree freedom therefore critical case overdetermined underdetermined occurs number equations number free variables equal every variable giving degree freedom exists corresponding constraint removing degree freedom underdetermined case contrast occurs system underconstrainedthat unknowns outnumber equations
