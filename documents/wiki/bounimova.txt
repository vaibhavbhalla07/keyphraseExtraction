device drivers programs allow software higher level computer programs interact hardware device software components act link devices operating systems communicating systems executing commands provide abstraction layer software also mediate communication operating system kernel devices usually operating systems comes support common device drivers usually hardware vendors provide device driver hardware devices platforms aggressive scaling hardware devices complex software components made device driver development process cumbersome complex size functionality drivers started increasing device drivers became key factor defining reliability system created incentive towards automatic synthesis verification device drivers article sheds light approaches synthesis verification device drivers
