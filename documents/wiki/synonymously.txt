synonymous substitution often called silent substitution though always silent evolutionary substitution one base another exon gene coding protein produced amino acid sequence modified possible genetic code degenerate meaning amino acids coded one three base pair codon since codons given amino acid differ one base pair others coding amino acid mutation replaces normal base one alternatives result incorporation amino acid growing polypeptide chain gene translated synonymous substitutions mutations affecting noncoding dna often considered silent mutations however always case mutation silent synonymous mutations affect transcription splicing mrna transport translation could alter phenotype rendering synonymous mutation non silent substrate specificity trna rare codon affect timing translation turn co translational folding protein reflected codon usage bias observed many species nonsynonymous substitution results change amino acid may arbitrarily classified conservative change amino acid similar physiochemical properties semi conservative e g negative positively charged amino acid radical vastly different amino acid
