point cloud set data points coordinate system three dimensional coordinate system points usually defined x y z coordinates often intended represent external surface object point clouds may created d scanners devices measure large number points object surface often output point cloud data file point cloud represents set points device measured output d scanning processes point clouds used many purposes including create d cad models manufactured parts metrology quality inspection multitude visualization animation rendering mass customization applications point clouds directly rendered inspected usually point clouds generally directly usable d applications therefore usually converted polygon mesh triangle mesh models nurbs surface models cad models process commonly referred surface reconstruction many techniques converting point cloud d surface approaches like delaunay triangulation alpha shapes ball pivoting build network triangles existing vertices point cloud approaches convert point cloud volumetric distance field reconstruct implicit surface defined marching cubes algorithm one application point clouds directly usable industrial metrology inspection using industrial computed tomography point cloud manufactured part aligned cad model even another point cloud compared check differences differences displayed color maps give visual indicator deviation manufactured part cad model geometric dimensions tolerances also extracted directly point cloud point clouds also used represent volumetric data used example medical imaging using point clouds multi sampling data compression achieved geographic information systems point clouds one sources used make digital elevation model terrain also used generate d models urban environments
