mathematics degenerate case limiting case element class objects qualitatively different rest class hence belongs another usually simpler class degeneracy condition degenerate case definitions many classes composite structured objects include often implicitly inequalities example angles side lengths triangle supposed positive limiting cases one several inequalities become equalities degeneracies case triangles one degenerate triangle least one side length angle zero often degenerate cases exceptional cases changes usual dimension cardinality object part occur example triangle object dimension two degenerate triangle contained line dimension thus one similarly solution set system equations depends parameters generally fixed cardinality dimension cardinality dimension may different exceptional values called degenerate cases degenerate case solution set said degenerate classes composite objects degenerate cases depend properties specifically studied particular class objects may often defined characterized systems equations commonly given class objects may defined several different systems equations different systems equations may lead different degenerate cases characterizing non degenerate cases may reason general definition degeneracy although concept widely used defined needed specific situation degenerate case thus special features makes non generic however non generic cases degenerate example right triangles isosceles triangles equilateral triangles non generic non degenerate frequently degenerate cases correspond singularities either object configuration space example conic section degenerate singular points
