global climate models gcms used climate studies climate projections run coarse spatial resolution typically order kilometres mi unable resolve important sub grid scale features clouds topography result gcm output used local impact studies overcome problem downscaling methods developed obtain local scale weather climate particularly surface level regional scale atmospheric variables provided gcms two main forms downscaling technique exist one form dynamical downscaling output gcm used drive regional numerical model higher spatial resolution therefore able simulate local conditions greater detail form statistical downscaling statistical relationship established observations large scale variables like atmospheric surface pressure local variable like wind speed particular site relationship subsequently used gcm data obtain local variables gcm output wilby wigley divided downscaling four categories regression methods weather pattern based approaches stochastic weather generators statistical downscaling methods limited area modeling among approaches regression methods preferred ease implementation low computation requirements
