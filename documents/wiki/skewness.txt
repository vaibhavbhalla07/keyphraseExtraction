probability theory statistics skewness measure asymmetry probability distribution real valued random variable mean skewness value positive negative undefined qualitative interpretation skew complicated unintuitive skew refer direction curve appears leaning fact opposite true unimodal distribution negative skew indicates tail left side probability density function longer fatter right side distinguish two kinds shape conversely positive skew indicates tail right side longer fatter left side cases one tail long tail fat skewness obey simple rule example zero value means tails sides mean balance overall case symmetric distribution also true asymmetric distribution asymmetries even one tail long thin short fat multimodal distributions discrete distributions skewness also difficult interpret importantly skewness determine relationship mean median cases necessary data might transformed normal distribution
