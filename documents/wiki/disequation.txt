constraint logic programming form constraint programming logic programming extended include concepts constraint satisfaction constraint logic program logic program contains constraints body clauses example clause including constraint x y x y b x c y clause x y constraint x y b x c y literals regular logic programming clause states one condition statement x y holds x y greater zero b x c y true regular logic programming programs queried provability goal may contain constraints addition literals proof goal composed clauses whose bodies satisfiable constraints literals turn proved using clauses execution performed interpreter starts goal recursively scans clauses trying prove goal constraints encountered scan placed set called constraint store set found unsatisfiable interpreter backtracks trying use clauses proving goal practice satisfiability constraint store may checked using incomplete algorithm always detect inconsistency
