mathematics viscosity solution concept introduced early pierre louis lions michael g crandall generalization classical concept meant solution partial differential equation pde found viscosity solution natural solution concept use many applications pde including example first order equations arising optimal control hamiltonjacobi equation differential games isaacs equation front evolution problems well second order equations ones arising stochastic optimal control stochastic differential games classical concept pde f x u d u d u displaystyle f x u du d u domain x displaystyle x omega solution find function u x continuous differentiable entire domain x displaystyle x u displaystyle u d u displaystyle du d u displaystyle d u satisfy equation every point scalar equation degenerate elliptic defined one define type weak solution called viscosity solution viscosity solution concept u need everywhere differentiable may points either d u displaystyle du d u displaystyle d u exist yet u satisfies equation appropriate generalized sense definition allows certain kind singularities existence uniqueness stability uniform limits hold large class equations
