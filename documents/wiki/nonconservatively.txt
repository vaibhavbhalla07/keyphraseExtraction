conservative force force property total work done moving particle two points independent taken path equivalently particle travels closed loop net work done sum force acting along path multiplied displacement conservative force zero conservative force dependent position object force conservative possible assign numerical value potential point object moves one location another force changes potential energy object amount depend path taken force conservative defining scalar potential possible taking different paths would lead conflicting potential differences start end points gravitational force example conservative force frictional force example non conservative force examples conservative forces force elastic spring electrostatic force two electric charges magnetic force two magnetic poles last two forces called central forces act along line joining centres two charged magnetized bodies thus central forces conservative forces
