unburned hydrocarbons uhcs hydrocarbons emitted petroleum burned engine unburned fuel emitted combustor emission caused fuel avoiding flame zones example piston engines fuel air mixture hides flame crevices provided piston ring grooves regions combustion chamber may weak flame either fuel lean fuel rich conditions consequently low combustion temperature regions cause intermediate species formaldehyde alkenes emitted sometimes term products incomplete combustion pics used describe species
