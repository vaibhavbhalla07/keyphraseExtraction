linear algebra inner product space vector space additional structure called inner product additional structure associates pair vectors space scalar quantity known inner product vectors inner products allow rigorous introduction intuitive geometrical notions length vector angle two vectors also provide means defining orthogonality vectors zero inner product inner product spaces generalize euclidean spaces inner product dot product also known scalar product vector spaces possibly infinite dimension studied functional analysis inner product naturally induces associated norm thus inner product space also normed vector space complete space inner product called hilbert space incomplete space inner product called pre hilbert space since completion respect norm induced inner product hilbert space inner product spaces field complex numbers sometimes referred unitary spaces
