mathematics sequence enumerated collection objects repetitions allowed like set contains members also called elements terms number elements possibly infinite called length sequence unlike set order matters exactly elements appear multiple times different positions sequence formally sequence defined function whose domain either set natural numbers infinite sequences set first n natural numbers sequence finite length n position element sequence rank index integer element image depends context specific convention first element index symbol chosen denoting sequence nth element sequence denoted symbol n subscript example nth element fibonacci sequence generally denoted fn example m r y sequence letters letter m first y last sequence differs r m y also sequence contains number two different positions valid sequence sequences finite examples infinite sequence even positive integers computing computer science finite sequences sometimes called strings words lists different names commonly corresponding different ways represent computer memory infinite sequences called streams empty sequence included notions sequence may excluded depending context
