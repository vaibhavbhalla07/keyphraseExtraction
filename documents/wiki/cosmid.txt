cosmid type hybrid plasmid contains lambda phage cos sequence cosmids cos sites plasmid cosmids dna sequences originally lambda phage often used cloning vector genetic engineering cosmids used build genomic libraries first described collins hohn cosmids contain normally kb dna limits based normal bacteriophage packaging size replicate plasmids suitable origin replication example sv ori mammalian cells cole ori double stranded dna replication f ori single stranded dna replication prokaryotes frequently also contain gene selection antibiotic resistance transformed cells identified plating medium containing antibiotic cells take cosmid would unable grow unlike plasmids also packaged phage capsids allows foreign genes transferred cells transduction plasmids become unstable certain amount dna inserted increased size conducive recombination circumvent phage transduction used instead made possible cohesive ends also known cos sites way similar using lambda phage vector except lambda genes deleted exception cos sequence
