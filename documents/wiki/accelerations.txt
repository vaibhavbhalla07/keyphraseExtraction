acceleration physics rate change velocity object respect time object acceleration net result forces acting object described newton second law si unit acceleration metre per second squared m accelerations vector quantities magnitude direction add according parallelogram law vector calculated net force equal product object mass scalar quantity acceleration example car starts standstill zero relative velocity travels straight line increasing speeds accelerating direction travel car turns acceleration occurs toward new direction example call forward acceleration car linear acceleration passengers car might experience force pushing back seats changing direction might call non linear acceleration passengers might experience sideways force speed car decreases acceleration opposite direction direction vehicle sometimes called deceleration passengers may experience deceleration force lifting forwards mathematically separate formula deceleration changes velocity accelerations linear non linear deceleration might felt passengers velocity speed direction matches car
