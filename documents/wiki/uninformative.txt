bayesian statistical inference prior probability distribution often simply called prior uncertain quantity probability distribution would express one beliefs quantity evidence taken account example prior could probability distribution representing relative proportions voters vote particular politician future election unknown quantity may parameter model latent variable rather observable variable bayes theorem calculates renormalized pointwise product prior likelihood function produce posterior probability distribution conditional distribution uncertain quantity given data similarly prior probability random event uncertain proposition unconditional probability assigned relevant evidence taken account priors created using number methods prior determined past information previous experiments prior elicited purely subjective assessment experienced expert uninformative prior created reflect balance among outcomes information available priors also chosen according principle symmetry maximizing entropy given constraints examples jeffreys prior bernardo reference prior family conjugate priors exists choosing prior family simplifies calculation posterior distribution parameters prior distributions kind hyperparameter example one uses beta distribution model distribution parameter p bernoulli distribution p parameter underlying system bernoulli distribution parameters prior distribution beta distribution hence hyperparameters hyperparameters may hyperprior distributions expressing beliefs values bayesian model one level prior like called hierarchical bayes model
