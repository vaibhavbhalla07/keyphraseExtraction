mathematical optimization karushkuhntucker kkt conditions also known kuhntucker conditions first order necessary conditions solution nonlinear programming optimal provided regularity conditions satisfied allowing inequality constraints kkt approach nonlinear programming generalizes method lagrange multipliers allows equality constraints system equations inequalities corresponding kkt conditions usually solved directly except special cases closed form solution derived analytically general many optimization algorithms interpreted methods numerically solving kkt system equations inequalities kkt conditions originally named harold w kuhn albert w tucker first published conditions later scholars discovered necessary conditions problem stated william karush master thesis
