catalysis increase rate chemical reaction due participation additional substance called catalyst consumed catalyzed reaction continue act repeatedly often tiny amounts catalyst required principle general reactions occur faster catalyst require less activation energy catalyzed mechanisms catalyst usually reacts form temporary intermediate regenerates original catalyst cyclic process catalysts may classified either homogeneous heterogeneous homogeneous catalyst one whose molecules dispersed phase usually gaseous liquid reactant molecules heterogeneous catalyst one whose molecules phase reactants typically gases liquids adsorbed onto surface solid catalyst enzymes biocatalysts often considered third category
