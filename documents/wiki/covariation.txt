probability theory statistics covariance measure joint variability two random variables greater values one variable mainly correspond greater values variable holds lesser values e variables tend show similar behavior covariance positive opposite case greater values one variable mainly correspond lesser values e variables tend show opposite behavior covariance negative sign covariance therefore shows tendency linear relationship variables magnitude covariance easy interpret normalized hence depends magnitudes variables normalized version covariance correlation coefficient however shows magnitude strength linear relation distinction must made covariance two random variables population parameter seen property joint probability distribution sample covariance addition serving descriptor sample also serves estimated value population parameter
