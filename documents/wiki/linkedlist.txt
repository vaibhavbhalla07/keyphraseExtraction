computer science linked list linear collection data elements linear order given physical placement memory instead element points next data structure consisting group nodes together represent sequence simplest form node composed data reference words link next node sequence structure allows efficient insertion removal elements position sequence iteration complex variants add additional links allowing efficient insertion removal arbitrary element references linked lists among simplest common data structures used implement several common abstract data types including lists stacks queues associative arrays expressions though uncommon implement data structures directly without using list basis implementation principal benefit linked list conventional array list elements easily inserted removed without reallocation reorganization entire structure data items need stored contiguously memory disk array declared source code compiling running program linked lists allow insertion removal nodes point list constant number operations link previous link added removed maintained list traversal hand simple linked lists allow random access data form efficient indexing thus many basic operations obtaining last node list assuming last node maintained separate node reference list structure finding node contains given datum locating place new node inserted may require sequential scanning list elements advantages disadvantages using linked lists given
