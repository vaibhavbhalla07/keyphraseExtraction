computer science context data storage serialization process translating data structures object state format stored example file memory buffer transmitted example across network connection link reconstructed later possibly different computer environment resulting series bits reread according serialization format used create semantically identical clone original object many complex objects make extensive use references process straightforward serialization object oriented objects include associated methods previously linked process serializing object also called marshalling object opposite operation extracting data structure series bytes deserialization also called unmarshalling
