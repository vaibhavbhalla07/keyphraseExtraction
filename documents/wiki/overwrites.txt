data erasure sometimes referred data clearing data wiping software based method overwriting data aims completely destroy electronic data residing hard disk drive digital media using zeros ones overwrite data onto sectors device overwriting data storage device data rendered unrecoverable achieves data sanitization ideally software designed data erasure allow selection specific standard based unique needs verify overwriting methodology successful removed data across entire device permanent data erasure goes beyond basic file deletion commands remove direct pointers data disk sectors make data recovery possible common software tools unlike degaussing physical destruction render storage media unusable data erasure removes information leaving disk operable new flash memory based media implementations solid state drives usb flash drives cause data erasure techniques fail allowing remnant data recoverable software based overwriting uses software application write stream zeros ones meaningless pseudorandom data onto sectors hard disk drive key differentiators data erasure overwriting methods leave data intact raise risk data breach identity theft failure achieve regulatory compliance many data eradication programs also provide multiple overwrites support recognized government industry standards though single pass overwrite widely considered sufficient modern hard disk drives good software provide verification data removal necessary meeting certain standards protect data lost stolen media data erasure applications remotely destroy data password incorrectly entered data erasure tools also target specific data disk routine erasure providing hacking protection method less time consuming software encryption hardware firmware encryption built drive integrated controllers popular solution degradation performance
