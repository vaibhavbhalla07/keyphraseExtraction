computer science sequential access means group elements data memory array disk file magnetic tape data storage accessed predetermined ordered sequence sequential access sometimes way accessing data example tape may also access method choice example wanted process sequence data elements order however consistent definition sequential access sequentiality fact different sequentiality definitions lead different sequentiality quantification results spatial dimension request size strided distance backward accesses re accesses affect sequentiality temporal sequentiality characteristics multi stream inter arrival time threshold impact definition sequentiality data structures data structure said sequential access one visit values contains one particular order canonical example linked list indexing list sequential access requires o n time n index result many algorithms quicksort binary search degenerate bad algorithms even less efficient naive alternatives algorithms impractical without random access hand algorithms typically index require sequential access mergesort face penalty
