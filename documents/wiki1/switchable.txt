electrical engineering switch electrical component make break electrical circuit interrupting current diverting one conductor another mechanism switch removes restores conducting path circuit operated may operated manually example light switch keyboard button may operated moving object door may operated sensing element pressure temperature flow switch one sets contacts may operate simultaneously sequentially alternately switches high powered circuits must operate rapidly prevent destructive arcing may include special features assist rapidly interrupting heavy current multiple forms actuators used operation hand sense position level temperature flow special types used example control machinery reverse electric motors sense liquid level many specialized forms exist common use control lighting multiple switches may wired one circuit allow convenient control light fixtures analogy devices select one possible paths electric currents devices route information computer network also called switches usually complicated simple electromechanical toggles pushbutton devices operate without direct human interaction
