system programming interrupt signal processor emitted hardware software indicating event needs immediate attention interrupt alerts processor high priority condition requiring interruption current code processor executing processor responds suspending current activities saving state executing function called interrupt handler interrupt service routine isr deal event interruption temporary interrupt handler finishes processor resumes normal activities two types interrupts hardware interrupts software interrupts hardware interrupts used devices communicate require attention operating system internally hardware interrupts implemented using electronic alerting signals sent processor external device either part computer disk controller external peripheral example pressing key keyboard moving mouse triggers hardware interrupts cause processor read keystroke mouse position unlike software type described hardware interrupts asynchronous occur middle instruction execution requiring additional care programming act initiating hardware interrupt referred interrupt request irq software interrupt caused either exceptional condition processor special instruction instruction set causes interrupt executed former often called trap exception used errors events occurring program execution exceptional enough cannot handled within program example divide zero exception thrown processor arithmetic logic unit commanded divide number zero instruction error impossible operating system catch exception choose abort instruction software interrupt instructions function similarly subroutine calls used variety purposes request services device drivers like interrupts sent disk controller request reading writing data disk interrupt interrupt handler number hardware interrupts limited number interrupt request irq lines processor may hundreds different software interrupts interrupts commonly used technique computer multitasking especially real time computing system said interrupt driven interrupts similar signals difference signals used ipc mediated kernel possibly via system calls handled processes interrupts mediated processor handled kernel kernel may pass interrupt signal process caused typical examples sigsegv sigbus sigill sigfpe
