computing stack trace also called stack backtrace stack traceback report active stack frames certain point time execution program program run memory often dynamically allocated two places stack heap memory contiguously allocated stack heap thus reflective names stack also refers programming construct thus differentiate stack referred program runtime stack technically block memory allocated stack cannot easily removed blocks memory allocated time function called program block memory allocated top runtime stack called activation record high level activation record allocates memory function parameters local variables declared function programmers commonly use stack tracing interactive post mortem debugging end users may see stack trace displayed part error message user report programmer stack trace allows tracking sequence nested functions called point stack trace generated post mortem scenario extends function failure occurred necessarily caused sibling calls appear stack trace example following python program contains error running program standard python interpreter produces following error message stack trace shows error occurs namely c function also shows c function called b called turn called code line last line program activation records three functions would arranged stack function would occupy bottom stack c function would occupy top stack
