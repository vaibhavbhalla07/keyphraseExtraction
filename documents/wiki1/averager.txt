boxcar averager alternative names gated integrator boxcar integrator electronic test instrument integrates signal input voltage defined waiting time trigger delay specified period time gate width averages multiple integration results samples mathematical description see boxcar function following block diagram shows main components signal pathways main purpose measurement technique improve signal noise ratio pulsed experiments often low duty cycle following three mechanisms signal integration acts first averaging step strongly suppresses noise components frequency reciprocal gate width higher time domain based selection signal parts actually carry information interest neglect signal parts noise present averaging defined number periods provides low pass filtering convenient adjustment time resolution similar lock amplifiers boxcar averagers mostly used analysis periodic signals whereas lock understood sophisticated band pass filters adjustable center frequency bandwidth boxcar averager allows define signal interest resulting time resolution mostly time domain
