physics vapor american vapour british substance gas phase temperature lower critical temperature means vapor condensed liquid increasing pressure without reducing temperature vapor different aerosol aerosol suspension tiny particles liquid solid within gas example water critical temperature k c f highest temperature liquid water exist atmosphere ordinary temperatures therefore gaseous water known water vapor condense liquid partial pressure increased sufficiently vapor may co exist liquid solid true two phases equilibrium gas partial pressure equal equilibrium vapor pressure liquid solid
