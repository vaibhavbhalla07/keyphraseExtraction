parametrization parameterization also parameterisation parametrisation process finding parametric equations curve surface generally manifold variety defined implicit equation inverse process called implicitization parameterize means express terms parameters parametrization mathematical process consisting expressing state system process model function independent quantities called parameters state system generally determined finite set coordinates parametrisation consists thus one function several real variables coordinate number parameters number degrees freedom system example position point moves curve three dimensional space determined time needed reach point starting fixed origin x y z coordinates point movement thus described parametric equation x f y g z h displaystyle begin aligned x f y g z h end aligned denotes time parametric equation determines completely curve without need interpretation time thus called parametric equation curve sometimes abbreviated saying one parametric curve one gets similarly parametric equation surface considering functions two parameters u
