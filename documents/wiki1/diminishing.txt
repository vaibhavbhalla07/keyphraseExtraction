economics diminishing returns decrease marginal incremental output production process amount single factor production incrementally increased amounts factors production stay constant law diminishing returns states productive processes adding one factor production holding others constant ceteris paribus point yield lower incremental per unit returns law diminishing returns imply adding factor decrease total production condition known negative returns though fact common common example adding people job assembly car factory floor point adding workers causes problems workers getting way frequently finding waiting access part processes producing one unit output per unit time eventually cost increasingly due inputs used less effectively another well studied example throwing headcount software development yielding brooks law law diminishing returns fundamental principle economics plays central role production theory
