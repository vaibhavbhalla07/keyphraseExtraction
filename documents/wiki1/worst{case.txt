computer science best worst average cases given algorithm express resource usage least average respectively usually resource considered running time e time complexity could also memory resource real time computing worst case execution time often particular concern since important know much time might needed worst case guarantee algorithm always finish time average performance worst case performance used algorithm analysis less widely found best case performance uses example best cases individual tasks known used improve accuracy overall worst case analysis computer scientists use probabilistic analysis techniques especially expected value determine expected running times terms used contexts example worst best case outcome planned epidemic worst case temperature electronic circuit element exposed etc components specified tolerance used devices must designed work properly worst case combination tolerances external conditions
