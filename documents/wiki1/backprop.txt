backpropagation method used artificial neural networks calculate error contribution neuron batch data image recognition multiple images processed special case older general technique called automatic differentiation context learning backpropagation commonly used gradient descent optimization algorithm adjust weight neurons calculating gradient loss function technique also sometimes called backward propagation errors error calculated output distributed back network layers backpropagation algorithm repeatedly rediscovered equivalent automatic differentiation reverse accumulation mode backpropagation requires known desired output input valueit therefore considered supervised learning method although used unsupervised networks autoencoders backpropagation also generalization delta rule multi layered feedforward networks made possible using chain rule iteratively compute gradients layer closely related gaussnewton algorithm part continuing research neural backpropagation backpropagation used gradient based optimizer l bfgs truncated newton backpropagation commonly used train deep neural networks term used describe neural networks one hidden layer
